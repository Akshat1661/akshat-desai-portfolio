# Akshat Desai | AI & Computer Vision Portfolio

**Live Site:** [https://akshat-desai-portfolio.vercel.app](https://akshat-desai-portfolio.vercel.app)

## 👋 About
Welcome to my personal portfolio repo. I built this site to showcase my work in **Computer Vision, Medical Imaging, and Hardware-Integrated AI**—and to prove that engineering portfolios don't have to be boring static pages.

It's designed with a "glassmorphism" aesthetic and features interactive system architecture diagrams that explain *how* my systems work, not just *what* they do.

## 🛠️ Under the Hood
I engineered this site for performance and scalability using modern web standards:
* **Core:** React 18 + Vite (for lightning-fast HMR and builds)
* **Type Safety:** TypeScript (strict mode)
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (utility-first architecture)
* **Motion:** Framer Motion (GPU-accelerated animations)
* **CI/CD:** Vercel (automated deployments on push)

## 📂 Featured Systems
* **Alzheimer's Disease Analysis:** A scalable pipeline processing 1,231+ MRI subjects on HPC clusters.
* **Lightwall Art Installation:** The "brain" behind a physical art piece, synchronizing 12 motors with Llama 3.2 in real-time.
* **Dining Staffing Prediction:** An enterprise dashboard combining LightGBM forecasting with an AWS Bedrock agent.
* **Verilog AI Assistant:** A self-correcting code generation tool that fixes its own syntax errors.
